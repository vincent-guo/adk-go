// Mode resolution.
//
// An agent that declares no Mode takes one from where it is placed: chat at a
// runner root, single_turn at a workflow node. State.Mode is the agent's own
// immutable declaration, so the resolved mode lives on the invocation instead —
// one agent instance serves many concurrent invocations, and the same instance
// may sit at two different placements.
//
// Three kinds of reader deliberately stay on the declaration.
//
// Those that only test for task mode — basic_processor, outputschema_processor,
// AgentNode's synthesizeMode, the runner's task-sub-agent scan — have nothing to
// resolve, because no placement ever defaults to task.
//
// isUntransferableMode asks about a PEER rather than the running agent, and a
// binding only ever describes the agent being run, so there is no binding for
// it to consult.
//
// installTaskTools runs at construction, where there is no invocation to
// consult. It does branch on single_turn, but it is choosing which tool to give
// a parent for a sub-agent, which is a property of the tree rather than of any
// one run.
//
// Every other reader resolves. A reader that tests for single_turn and skips
// the resolution disagrees with the request the flow actually builds.
//
// The binding names the agent it describes, and the name is part of the context
// KEY rather than of the value. Two properties follow, and both are needed.
//
// A binding never governs an agent it was not resolved for. A bare context value
// would be inherited by every nested activation — a peer reached by transfer, a
// child that declares its own mode — and would govern all of them.
//
// A binding also survives a nested activation that binds a different agent.
// Storing one pair under one key gave only the first property: a single_turn
// graph node that transferred to a chat peer had its slot overwritten, and when
// the peer transferred back the node's own agent was re-entered on the peer's
// context and fell back to chat, taking the identity preamble, the transfer
// instructions and the whole conversation with it. Placements nest, so the
// bindings have to nest too.

// context, which is what a re-entrant placement of the same agent should do.
// Binding a different agent leaves the first alone.
//
// An empty agentName is bound like any other. Config.Name is documented as
// required and nothing here can supply a missing one, but skipping the binding
// would silently turn a nameless agent at a graph node into a chat agent
// carrying the whole transcript. Binding "" leaves such an agent at the
